# Prediction of Cancer types using the Histopathology Images with the help of Deep Learning Framework - Convolutional neural network .
The dataset is taken from the various free public domains like kaggle, mendeley , google dataset etc., 
The model tries to classify the given histopathology image into its Corresponding cancer Class.
The model is trained over the Google Colab and the dataset is provided to the model from the drive using the Pathlib package .
 ## Dataset:
 Histopathology is the diagnosis and study of diseases of the tissues, and involves examining tissues and/or cells under a microscope. Histopathologists are responsible for making tissue diagnoses and helping clinicians manage a patient's care. Histopathology is the examination of a biopsy or surgical tissue specimen by a pathologist. The image analysis of histopathological samples is used to provide the final detailed diagnosis of several diseases, including most cancers. Afterward, the tissue slides are examined under a microscope by the pathologist.
